## Tasks

A. Modify Hello World

1.  Run the following Hugging Face and Gradio web application `helloApp` by using:
`python helloApp.py`.
2. Change this application to be a calculator that adds two numbers using the calculator function in my lib.
i.e. `from mylib.calculator import add`

* Reflection Question:  Why does a web framework like Gradio help build machine learning solutions faster?

B. Run the `summarizeApp.py` by using `python summarizeApp.py` and paste the text found in `text.txt`.

* Reflection Question:  Why is the model and model version specified?

C. On your own explore other Hugging Face models at https://huggingface.co/models and wire them into a Gradio application.

* Reflection Question:  What applications could you quickly build?
